### Create a custom search engine at Google

 Select the code, then copy it to your computer's clipboard (press _CTRL-C_ on PC, _CMD-C_ on Mac). We'll use that copied code within the plugin's settings.

### Configure the Settings

Let's check out the settings, go to _Settings > Custom Google Search_. 

![Custom Google Search Settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Custom-Google-Search-1.2.2-Settings.png)

 Paste the code that you previously copied from Google into the '_Embed Code/Search ID_**'** field. Select from the '_Display search results as_' options as follows:

*   _Standard Page_ - results will be displayed in a search page using the standard page template.
*   _Search Page_ - shows results in the theme's search template.
*   _Generated Page (risky)_ - will display a full width search with no sidebar.

Select a _Style_ for the visual display of search elements. You'll have the following options:

*   Default
*   Purple
*   Green
*   Coffee
*   Silver
*   Minimalist

Tick the '_Open clicked search result in same window_' option in order to have clicked links show in the same window, otherwise they will open in a new window. Tick the '_Hide search button_' option so the search button won't be seen, users can simply press the ENTER key to execute searches. Tick the '_Show sidebar on search page_' in order to show a sidebar when using the Generated Page option above. Specify your site's protocol from the following:

*   HTTP
*   HTTPS
*   Protocol-relative URLs

Select a theme for the popup used by the widget from the following:

*   flick
*   smoothness
*   ui-darkness
*   ui-lightness
*   vader

### Custom Google Search Widget

There will also be a new widget available at _Appearance > Widgets_: 

![Custom Google Search - Widget](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Custom-Google-Search-1.2.2-Widget.png)

 For the 'Display results' option, you can select from the following:

*   _in pop-up_ - displays results in a pop-up, using the theme specified in settings.
*   _at bottom of widget_ - displays results within the widget.
*   _on search page_ - takes user to search page where results are shown.

### The Front-end Experience

Custom Google Search integrates with WordPress and replaces standard searches with Google search results. Results will be shown depending on your settings. Here's how it looks with relatively default settings, using the Default style: 

![Custom Google Search - Front-end Default](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Custom-Google-Search-1.2.2-Style-Default.png)

 You'll also be able to access searches directly, just as with regular WordPress searches, like so: _yoursite.com/?s=wpmu_ Simply replace the 'wpmu' with your own search term.
